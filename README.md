The worst case time complexity for runningtime is O(n^2), as it iterates the entire array, potentially iterating backwards at each step.\
The space complexity is O(n) as it has an input space complexity of O(n) and an auxiliary space complexity of O(1).\

For ice cream parlor, I tried my best to come up with anything that might work but could not produce any code that would even past test cases. I had no idea what I was doing today.
